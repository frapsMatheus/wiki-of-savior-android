# Wiki of Savior - Android

This app and an iOS version were created as a fan project for the game [Tree of Savior](https://treeofsavior.com/page/main/). 
Without marketing, it reached more than 15k downloads on Android alone.

The app had 3 main features:
1. Show all the apps that the game had with info on where to find key information.
2. A calculator of card XP, is a calculator to understand how many cards do you have to gather through quests to reach a certain level in the game.
3. A stat calculator where you could set your class, your level, and stats points distribution to understand how would be your final character stats.

I stopped working on the project because the game was updating too fast. It would take too much time to keep adding the maps to keep the app relevant.
